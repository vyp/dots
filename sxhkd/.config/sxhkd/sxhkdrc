# Herbstluftwm Keybindings
# ========================

# Due to changes using xmodmap and xcape (see x/init), if focus is on the root
# window, the `super + Return' keybinding only executes it's command after
# another window gets focused, for whatever reason. :(
#
# `super + Super_R' (the same physical key chord) however does execute it's
# command as normal whether focus is on the root window or not. But we cannot
# just solely use this instead of `super + Return' because it also inserts a
# Return character into the currently focued window. This is not a problem if
# it's the root window, but obviously it's undesirable if focus is on a window.
# So having a keybinding for `super + Return' as well masks this side effect.
#
# $(herbstclient attr clients.focus) outputs information about the currently
# focused window, but otherwise has no output if focus is on the root window
# (i.e. no 'client' has focus). 
# super + Return
#   [[ $(herbstclient attr clients.focus) ]] && xterm
#
# super + Super_R
#   [[ $(herbstclient attr clients.focus) ]] || xterm
