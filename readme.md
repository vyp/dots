# ⚽ #goals

## 🚀 Free Software

- I should be able to use, study, modify, and share my modifications of all the
  software used in the setup. 🙈🙉🙊

**GNU** is the chosen OS due to it's unequivocal commitment to [free
software][free-sw]. Grand acclamation to **Dr. Richard Stallman** for creating
it and for creating the entire free software ideology and culture. I can
imagine the world would be a *much* worse place if he did not! 👏👏👏

## 🥗 Reproducibility

- I should be able to easily but flexibly use exactly the same setup across my
  various machines. 🖥️💻👩‍💻

**NixOS** is the chosen distribution because of it's clean, functional and
declarative approach to package and configuration management. I think that the
world would be a much better place if more people used Nix! ✨

## 💅 Mouseless Workflow

- I should be (physically) comfortable and safe when using my setup. 🛋️💆‍♀️

Obviously this highly depends on *you* and what you normally use a (general
purpose) computer for. For me, this means being able to keep my fingers on the
home row as much as possible as typing is the principle and most frequent
action in my usual workflow.

That means having keyboard shortcuts to do everything (instead of requiring
mouse or touchpad usage). Additionally, the keyboard shortcuts should be
composable and/or modal instead of requiring extensive chording (in the spirit
of **Vi**), so that they remain comfortable to press.

### 🏨 Window Manager

The first point of interaction after logging in is usually the window manager.
I've found that **herbstluftwm**'s model of window management is the perfect
balance of manual and automatic tiling window management *for me*.

*TODO: Add comparison to other popular window managers and explain why
herbstluftwm was chosen over them.*

### ✒️ Editor

Because typing is so prominent in my workflow, having a decent text editor to
follow the above goals is paramount.

I chose **Emacs** over Vim because Emacs provides a much more capable and
integrated environment that can still be controlled completely with vim-style
keybindings thanks to **Evil mode**. 😈

## 💄 Rice

- I should be looking at a pretty screen, especially since I look at it a lot.
  😍

  *TODO: Add screenshots here.*
</details>

## ♻️ Minimalism

- I should not have to waste time with unnecessary or superfluous stuff. ⏳

# Credits

I've probably missed some, and for that I apologize. It'd be close to
impossible to list *everyone* who deserves credit anyway. 😕
