# #goals

‼ This is just an outline, for expanded thoughts and reasoning, see
[doc/choices.org].

1. **Free Software:**

   - I should be able to use, study, modify, and share my modifications of all
     the software used in the setup. 🙈🙉🙊

     Many many thanks to **Dr. Richard Stallman** for creating the entire [free
     software][free-sw] ideology and culture, including **[GNU]**. I can imagine
     the world would be a *much worse* place if he did not. 🙇‍♀️

2. **Reproducibility:**

   - I should be able to easily but flexibly use exactly the same setup across
     my various machines.

     **[NixOS]** naturally plays an extremely integral part here because of it's
     clean, functional and declarative approach to package and configuration
     management.

     I think that the world would be a much better place if more people used
     Nix! So please check it out! ✨

3. **Comfort and Safety:**

   - I should be physically comfortable and safe when using my setup. 💆

4. **Rice:**

   - I should be viewing a 'modern' looking system.

5. **Minimalism:**

   - I should not have to waste time or energy with superfluous stuff.

# 📢 Shoutouts 📢

‼ I've probably missed some people, which I apologize for in advance.
Unfortunately, it would be close to impossible to list *everyone* who deserves
credit anyway.

- Bill Joy for creating [vi] and it's unique but extremely effective model of
  editing, which inspires many aspects of this setup.
- [@brammool] for creating [vim], which is my fallback editor. It's like a
  'modern' more usable version of vi.
- [@civodul] for creating [guix].
- [Dr. Richard Stallman][rms] for creating [emacs] and [GNU].
- Eben Moglen and [@bkuhn] for being copyleft champions.
- [@edolstra] for creating [NixOS].
- [@epsil] for creating [evil mode].
- [@t-wissmann] for creating [herbstluftwm].
  - Also helped me with creating a solution to move to the last focused window:
    https://github.com/herbstluftwm/herbstluftwm/issues/98#issuecomment-316342968
- Tom Lord for creating [guile].
  - And [@jimblandy], [@othermaciej], Mikael Djurfeldt, [@mvollmer],
    [@neiljerram], [@civodul] and [@wingo] for maintaining it over the years.
- [@ypnos] for helping me with creating a better solution to move to the last
  focused window:
