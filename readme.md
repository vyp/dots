## Free Software

As a moral imperative, the setup should be 100% *free as in freedom*.

*Featuring:*

- **[GNU]**

[GNU]: https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu.en.html

## Reproducibility

The setup should be easy to reliably replicate.

The [four essential freedoms] of free software is a requirement for this
because nonfree software by definition limits the reproducibility of software.

keybindings.
