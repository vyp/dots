# #goals

## Free Software

As a moral imperative, the setup should be 100% *free as in freedom*.

*Featuring:*

- **[GNU](https://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu.en.html)**

## Reproducibility

The setup should be easy to reliably replicate.

The [four essential freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html)
of free software is a requirement for this because nonfree software by
definition limits the reproducibility of software.

*Featuring:*

- **[NixOS](https://nixos.org)**

## Mouseless Workflow

The setup should be 100% controllable through *comfortable* vim-inspired
keybindings.

*Featuring:*

- **[herbstluftwm](http://www.herbstluftwm.org)**
- **[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)** with
  **[Evil Mode](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil)**
