* Emacs
** Behaviour

- Use epl library to check dependencies to help with removing packages.
- aggressive indent.
- origami.el
- lispyville.
- embrace.el and evil-embrace.el
- general.el
  - Remember this allows to rebind "SPC co" to just "co" (see the readme).
    - After this happens, =org-content= keybinding could probably become "SPC co"
      instead, so it gives more incentive to get this done earlier so that the
      fingers don't get too used to the current bindings!
- Transposing (including words).
- Expand region.
- Emmet.
- Highlight TODOs.
- outshine.

** Keybindings

- Hydra!
- Eval'ing, eval region.
- Better keybinding to evaluate elisp in minibuffer.
- Allow =gg= in ibuffer by removing =g= for refresh.
- "Completion List", "Packages", "Compile-log", "Messages", "Backtrace" buffers.

** Appearance

- Total number of lines in mode line.
- Anzu and evil-anzu.
- Switch theme keybinding/function.
  - Use sanityinc's elisp to fix fci-mode colour when switching.
  - Also to be able to put all elisp in one file, select initial theme by
    environment variable rather than file.
- Refactor out the common parts of the theme.el file somehow.

** Special

- Ibuffer
- Ranger/deer/dired.
- Ido or helm?
- Terminal/eshell/zsh.
- MPD client.
- Image viewer.
- Mail.
- RSS.

* Themes
** Gruvbox-light

- *qutebrowser*
  - move qutebrowser theme to themes directory => Makefile.
    - this can probably only happen after
      [[https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser/issues/499]] or
      [[https://github.com/The-Compiler/qutebrowser/issues/381]] because the
      [colors] section will be re-added after every update anyway.
  - remove coloured backgrounds from different status bar types, and make
    them coloured foregrounds instead.

* Other

- Update yasnippet repository location.
- Add im fell dw pica and alegreya sans to ui-bin.
- use environment variables for theme settings, as much as possible.
  - xmonad and the panel's settings have gruvbox-light theme settings
    hardcoded into them.
  - Actually don't think that environment variables will work because some sort
    of state is still needed to set the environment variables. But then the
    commands to set the environment variables would have to be outside the
    repository, meaning that it would be harder to reproduce than just using the
    current file stow-symlinking system.
- copy over the patch and generic.nix files for custom rustc nix expressions?
- qutebrowser git clone in bootstrap script should somehow correspond/checkout
  to the correct commit.
- add limey to fonts options => figure out size issue (because it's bitmap
  anyway), and find out if it required negative letter space..
- make the vim swap file section in the global gitignore (and gitignores of
  other repositories) the same as the one in this repository.
- shell => search command history.
- rewrite upd script to only update emacs packages if :files (from recipe)
  changed.
- use relative paths in scripts by first cd'ing to the directory the script is
  located in: [[http://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/4093264]] ?
  - OR, use environment variables instead ??
- pandoc and latex templates.
- fzf looks very useful.
